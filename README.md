Remote Desktop Test
===================

A series of server and client apps testing remote desktop implementations.

Just playing to my interests.

Goals:
* Use H.264 codec for transmission.
* Minimize latency as much as feasible.
* Minimize CPU usage while keeping latency and quality high.
* Utilize Bonjour services to broadcast and find endpoints.
* Provide display first, mouse input second and keyboard last.

Intended clients/servers:
* OSX native server
* Windows .Net server
* iOS client
* Android (Ouya???) client
* Raspberry Pi client
